I developed my own website using HTML and CSS and compiling into Sass for its deployment. The project was entirely developed by myself and contains links to some of the other projects that I have also developed (including other sites and games)

The site has a responsive front-end, reacting to user inputs, allowing for easy navigation and usability throughout the site. It also contains a contact form which allows users to send me an email, making contacting me a lot easier and simpler.
